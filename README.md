# STAT301 - Diabetes Prediction through Logistic Regression Model

This project was completed in Summer 2024 as part of the 3rd-year course, STAT301: Statistical Modelling for Data Science. The goal was to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for this project consists of patient health indicators, and the goal was to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.
